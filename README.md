# _Titanic Survival Prediction_

## Author: Muhammad Taimoor Khan

## Overview

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This repository contains the code and analysis for predicting passenger survival aboard the Titanic using machine learning. Dive into the details of data analysis, preprocessing, and model training to uncover insights from this historical dataset.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the code:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code

- Clone the repository:
git clone insert_your_github_link_here
cd Titanic-Survival-Prediction

- Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb

## Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Load the Titanic dataset from the train.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Handle missing values and perform data imputation.
- Explore and analyze key features of the dataset.

## Data Analysis
- Utilize descriptive statistics to understand the dataset.
- Visualize survival rates, gender distribution, and passenger class information.

## Data Visualization
- Create informative count plots using Seaborn to visualize survival, gender, and passenger class distribution.

## Model Training
### Logistic Regression
- Train a Logistic Regression model on the dataset.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy on both training and testing data.

### Random Forest Classifier
- Implement a Random Forest Classifier and assess its performance on training and testing data.

## Results
### Logistic Regression:

- Training Accuracy: 80%
- Testing Accuracy: 78%

### Random Forest Classifier:

- Training Accuracy: 98%
- Testing Accuracy: 82%
